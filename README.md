# Lecture 1

- Deep Learning will be confusing topic requires concentration
- Why do we need Deep Learning?
    - When we have lots of data
    - In Machine Learning we have to do the feature engineering while in Deep Learning it does that by itself
    - When we have to derive something from image and text or work like human brain
    - Preserving meaning of text
- Its main objective is
    - Model should automatically understand which feature is important
    - Data we are giving more and more everyday (0.5 Billion → 1 Billion → 10 Billion → 100 Billion) but its performance was not increasing in Machine Learning, prediction and accuracy was not increasing, performance does not improve with data
    - Deep Learning is a combination of Statistics, Algebra, Calculus, Programming.
    - Will give numerical on ANN to understand how its working?
    - In Deep Learning as the data size improves, the performance also improves

- What is a Neural Network?-
- What is Neuron?
    - Basic unit of Human Brain
    - They continuously activate and deactivate
    - It hurts when we touch hot glass, information goes from neuron to brain.
- Neural Network has a hidden layer, input layer, output layer
- Deep Learning understanding requires Machine Learning which is subset of AI
    - It is a combination of statistics and computation

***Difference between R2 and Adjusted R2?***

No Global and Local Minima and Gradient Descent stuff taught till now (it will be there as its both in Deep Learning and Machine Learning?

Issue in Machine Learning, automatic assignment of features is there in Deep Learning

We have given the input and then it decides, which features are to be selected and which are to be removed. 

It can activate and deactivate any feature, automatic feature extraction and management is done, weightage is assigned to every connection

For e.g. you have features like

Age, Height, Weight, Gender, Income and you have to predict weight, what will be the feature selection?

Height, Age, Gender will be the feature, Gender will also have less role to play too

Automatic weight will be assigned by Neural Network, it will relate everything automatically, it can even put weight 0 too, automatic handling is there

In Machine Learning, you have to tell everything yourself, which feature to keep and remove

In Deep Learning like Human Brain, if lion comes you run

but in Machine Learning we keep on checkiing what is the animal and then decide whether to run or not

We will mostly work on Google Colab and with tools like Keras and Tensorflow

If you wanna do more practicals, you will have to the theory by yourself. 

Theory is also complicated which needs to be understood a lot

For getting a job the red ones are really crucical

Practicals can be done by assigning my projects to you.

Recently, you guys must have the retail project, it was to check the knowledge, there was a requirement in my team. 

Vandit Sir sent it, it had some loophole, it was my project where are you going, requirement in my team, thing has been put on hold. 

Also make PPT, one was from MSc other from Mtech

You can also get these real life projects from me, direct industrial projects will be given to you on the contrary side

Libraries we will mostly use Keras and Tensorflow not Pytorch.

Industry mostly requires only these.

To do more practicals you have to counter the theory yourself, mot probably that you will have in understanding is around BackPropagation Algorithm numericals, which will take 2-4 hours. Optimizer will have like Stochastic optimizer, Adam, RMSE different different optimizer, if you keep on defining the equation it will take a lot of time. Everything will be presented in easy way, but you will have to cover the theory on yourself

CNN and RNN won’t take much time. Apart from it I will also give you some real life projects if I will get time for that. Recommendation System needs to be 

Timings will 10-12 Deep Learning and 2-4 Data Visualization

A lot of patience will be needed in this, else things will bounce off 

# Natural Language Processing

- Coding take it as a hobby.
- Python is the simplest of all languages, its taught in high schools
- Improve your attitude, things will change
- Coding, ML, Stats
- EXL still works on Excel
- Choose one skill and become good at that
- Learn LinkedIn profile creation from Udemy, Youtube
- Communication Skill is really important, watch Movies and join Group Discussion groups
- If you want something 6 months later, you have to start today.
- What Recruiter searches for: Naukri, Indeed.
- As a fresher, start applying for small companies - search citywise small companies, only small cities not Bangalore, Chennai but rather Chandigarh, Ahemdabad, Jaipur, Vishakhapatnam, Mysore, Kochi, Coimbatore
- Look at where your Seniors are working and apply there.
- List might not come handy currently, might be when you switch later
- CH Edge Makers give discount to IET students, you might also get that
- Getting different perspective is also important
- Resume: Canva, Overleaf
- Keyword should be there, text shouldn’t be image
- books - Data Mining Concepts  Kamber, Micheilne, Pel, Jian
- Learn RegEx yourself
- Deep NLP (try nlp there also)
- Third Semester will revolve around ML, DL, NLP, CV, DV
- Transfer Learning (BERT, fasttext, glove, Google News Words to Vec)
- 60% NLP will learn around NLTK, Spacy, Textblob, gensim, wordcloud
